        The first drawback of anger is that it destroys your inner peace; the
        second is that it distorts your view of reality. If you think about this
        and come to understand that anger is really unhelpful, that it is only
        destructive, you can begin to distance yourself from anger.

        It is clear that feelings of love, affection, closeness and compassion
        bring happiness. I believe that every one of us has the means to be
        happy, to access the warm and compassionate states of mind that bring
        happiness. In fact, it is one of my fundamental beliefs that not only do
        we inherently possess the potential for compassion, but I believe that
        the basic or underlying nature of human beings is gentleness.
